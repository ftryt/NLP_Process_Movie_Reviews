# Now we train model so it will have parameters studied:

# Multinomial Naive Bayes
# How it works (simplified)
# It assumes that all words are independent of each other (naive assumption).
# The model estimates how likely a word is to appear in positive or negative text.
# Then, for new text, it calculates which class has a higher probability.
# Often more accurate than Naive Bayes.

# Logistic Regression
# Very popular for binary classification.
# Learns to find the linear boundary between classes.
# Gives good results on text problems.
